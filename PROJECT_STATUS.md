## ⚠️ Current Issues & Technical Debt

### **Code Quality Issues (Identified by Flutter Analyze)**
1. **Null Safety Warnings**
   - `lib/screens/flashcard_screen.dart:91:31` - unnecessary null comparison
   - `lib/screens/flashcard_screen.dart:127:28` - unnecessary null comparison
   - `lib/screens/flashcard_screen.dart:139:27` - unnecessary non-null assertion

2. **Code Optimization**
   - `lib/screens/quiz_screen.dart:30:20` - make `_results` field final
   - `lib/screens/quiz_screen.dart:195:18` - unnecessary `toList()` in spread
   - `lib/services/word_service.dart:99:16` - unused `_updateStreak` method

3. **Import Issues**
   - `lib/widgets/app_drawer.dart:4:8` - unused import

4. **Context Issues**
   - `lib/main.dart:25:7` - BuildContext used across async gaps

5. **Test Issues**
   - `test/widget_test.dart:16:35` - references non-existent 'MyApp' class

## 🔧 Critical Missing Features

### **1. Data Persistence (CRITICAL)**
- **Current State**: All data stored in memory only
- **Problem**: All progress lost when app restarts
- **Impact**: Makes the app essentially unusable for real learning
- **Solution Needed**: Implement local storage (SQLite/Hive) or cloud storage

### **2. Progress Screen (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Current State**: Static placeholder data
- **Missing Features**:
  - Real progress tracking integration
  - Visual charts and graphs
  - Streak tracking display
  - Historical performance data
  - Learning analytics

### **3. Enhanced Learning Features**
- **Spaced Repetition Algorithm**: Current system is basic
- **Word Bank Management**: Limited to hardcoded words
- **Custom Word Addition**: Users can't add their own words
- **Audio Pronunciation**: No sound support
- **Difficulty Levels**: All words treated equally

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **For Development**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Harish5862/learningtest.git
cd learningtest
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Run tests (after fixing test issues)
flutter test
```

### **For Testing**
1. **Home Screen**: View daily stats and quick actions
2. **Flashcards**: Learn new words with interactive cards
3. **Quiz Modes**: 
   - Take quiz on new words
   - Practice mistakes via drawer menu
   - Review reminders via drawer menu
4. **Navigation**: Use drawer menu to switch between modes

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### **Technical Decisions**
- **Provider vs Bloc**: Chose Provider for simplicity
- **Local vs Cloud Storage**: Start with local, plan for cloud sync
- **Word Bank**: Currently hardcoded, plan for dynamic loading

### **Performance Considerations**
- In-memory storage is fast but limited
- Large word banks may need pagination
- Consider lazy loading for better performance

### **Accessibility**
- Add screen reader support
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Consider font size options
